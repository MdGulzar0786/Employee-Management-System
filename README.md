# Employee-Management-System
java, OOPs, Console-based Application

Designed and implemented a Text-based User Interface (TUI) application to manage employee records using pure Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system supports core functionalities including:

Add, Remove, Update, and View employee details

Applied encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction to manage employee data models and service layers

Ensured a clean and modular codebase, separating data handling from business logic

Enhanced user experience with clear prompts, validation checks, and structured output formatting

Scalable design allowing easy transition to GUI or database integration in future

This project demonstrates strong foundational understanding of OOP, class design, and real-world problem solving in Java.
